# SuperPower
Here you should find the best power supplies for your low-power projects. Because of different requirements for an Raspberry Pi and micro-controllers like the ESP32 we split the project into two boards, one for the Raspberry Pi (SuperPower-Rpi) and one for micro-controllers (SuperPower-uC) with low power.

##### [SuperPower-Rpi](/SuperPower-RPi/) for Raspberry Pi

##### [SuperPower-uC](/SuperPower-uC/) for micro-controllers and low-power devices
