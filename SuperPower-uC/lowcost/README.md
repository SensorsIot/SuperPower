# Notes

- xlsx BOM is lacking some pricing because LCSC is out of stock on those at the time of generating the BOM.
- `doBomHtml.sh` Requires `InteractiveHtmlBom` and generates HTML BOM
- `kicostbat.sh` requires `kicost` and generates BOM with pricing and facilities for ordering components.
- Original schematic was updates so that the `LCSC` fields are now `lcsc#` for compatibility with `kicost`
